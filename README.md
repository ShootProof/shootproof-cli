# ShootProof Command Line Tool

Command line client for interacting with the [ShootProof API](http://developer.shootproof.com).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ShootProof/shootproof-cli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ShootProof/shootproof-cli)

## Installation

_NOTICE: Your system must have PHP 5.4 or later installed in order to use the ShootProof command line tool. This tool is not currently supported on Windows, as it makes use of [POSIX](http://php.net/posix) functions._

Download the `shootproof-cli.phar` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/ShootProof/shootproof-cli/releases/latest) and place it in `/usr/local/bin` or wherever it's accessible from your `PATH`.

``` bash
$ chmod +x shootproof-cli.phar
$ mv shootproof-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/shootproof-cli
```

Now `shootproof-cli` should be available for you to use from the command line.

Optionally, you may clone this repository and [build the phar file yourself](#building-the-phar-file).


## Usage

```
shootproof-cli <command> [options]
```

### Supported Commands

* help [command] - gets usage instructions for the script or for a script command
* push - uploads photos to a ShootProof event or album
* pull - downloads photos from a ShootProof event or album
* accesslevel - sets the access level for a ShootProof event

### Configuration

This client requires certain options to be set which may be set explicitly on the command line, or in a configuration file. The default location of the configuration file is `~/.shootproof`.

The configuration file may contain some or all of the following settings:

```
appId=<id>
accessToken=<token>
verbosity=<level>
haltOnError=true
retryLimit=<limit>
email=<email>
```

See `.shootproof-sample` for a minimal example of the configuration file.


## Required Permissions

For this script to operate properly, you must have an access token authorized for the following scopes:

* sp.album.create
* sp.album.get_photos
* sp.event.create
* sp.event.get_photos
* sp.event.set_access_level
* sp.photo.upload
* sp.photo.delete

Non-expiring access tokens are available from ShootProof on request.


## Contributing

Generated source code documentation is published [here](https://shootproof.github.io/shootproof-cli/).

### Building the Phar File

The ShootProof command line tool is distributed as an executable [phar](http://php.net/phar) file. The `build.php` script handles building this file.

To build `shootproof-cli.phar`, first make sure that phar creation is enabled in your php.ini file:

```
phar.readonly = 0
```

To build the phar file, change to the location of your `shootproof-cli` project clone and execute the `build.php` script:

``` bash
$ php build.php
```

This will create a `build/` directory and place the generated `shootproof-cli.phar` file there.

### Preparing a Release

When preparing a release, clean things up with Composer before building the phar file:

``` bash
$ composer install --no-dev --prefer-source --optimize-autoloader
```

Now, you may build the phar file, and it will be cleaner and more compact.

### Generating and Publishing Documentation from Source Code

To generate source code documentation with [ApiGen](http://www.apigen.org/) and publish to GitHub pages:

``` bash
$ git checkout master
$ apigen generate
$ git stash
$ git checkout gh-pages
$ cp -R build/apidocs/* .
$ git add *
$ git commit -m "Generated documentation with ApiGen"
$ git push origin gh-pages
$ git checkout master
$ git stash pop
```
