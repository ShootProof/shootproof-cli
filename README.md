# ShootProof Command Line Tool

Command line client for interacting with the [ShootProof API](http://developer.shootproof.com).

## Installation

_Your system must have PHP 5.4 or later installed in order to use the ShootProof command line tool._

Download the `shootproof-cli.phar` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/shootproof/shootproof-cli/releases) and place it in `/usr/local/bin` or wherever it's accessible from your `PATH`.

``` bash
$ chmod +x shootproof-cli.phar
$ mv shootproof-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/shootproof-cli
```

Now `shootproof-cli` should be available for you to use from the command line.

Optionally, you may clone this repository and [build the phar file yourself](#building-the-phar-file).


## Usage

```
shootproof-cli <command> [options]
```

### Supported Commands

* help [command] - gets usage instructions for the script or for a script command
* push - uploads photos to a ShootProof event or album
* pull - downloads photos from a ShootProof event or album
* accesslevel - sets the access level for a ShootProof event

### Configuration

This client requires certain options to be set which may be set explicitly on the command line, or in a configuration file. The default location of the configuration file is `~/.shootproof`.

The configuration file may contain some or all of the following settings:

```
appId=<id>
accessToken=<token>
verbosity=<level>
haltOnError=true
retryLimit=<limit>
email=<email>
```

See `.shootproof-sample` for a minimal example of the configuration file.


## Required Permissions

For this script to operate properly, you must have an access token authorized for the following scopes:

* sp.album.create
* sp.album.get_photos
* sp.event.create
* sp.event.get_photos
* sp.event.set_access_level
* sp.photo.upload
* sp.photo.delete

Non-expiring access tokens are available from ShootProof on request.


## Building the Phar File

The ShootProof command line tool is distributed as an executable [phar](http://php.net/phar) file. The `build.php` script handles building this file.

To build `shootproof-cli.phar`, first make sure that phar creation is enabled in your php.ini file:

```
phar.readonly = 0
```

To build the phar file, change to the location of your `shootproof-cli` project clone and execute the `build.php` script line this:

```
$ php build.php
```

This will create a `build/` directory and place the generated `shootproof-cli.phar` file there.
