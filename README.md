# ShootProof Command Line Tool

Command line client for interacting with the [ShootProof API](http://developer.shootproof.com).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ShootProof/shootproof-cli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ShootProof/shootproof-cli)

## Installation

_NOTICE: Your system must have PHP 5.4 or later installed in order to use the ShootProof command line tool. This tool is not currently supported on Windows, as it makes use of [POSIX](http://php.net/posix) functions._

Download the `shootproof-cli.phar` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/ShootProof/shootproof-cli/releases/latest) and place it in `/usr/local/bin` or wherever it's accessible from your `PATH`.

``` bash
$ chmod +x shootproof-cli.phar
$ mv shootproof-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/shootproof-cli
```

Now `shootproof-cli` should be available for you to use from the command line.

Optionally, you may clone this repository and [build the phar file yourself](#building-the-phar-file).


## Usage

```
shootproof-cli <command> [options]
```

### Supported Commands

* help [command] - gets usage instructions for the script or for a script command
* push - uploads photos to a ShootProof event or album
* pull - downloads photos from a ShootProof event or album
* accesslevel - sets the access level for a ShootProof event

### Configuration

This client requires certain options to be set which may be set explicitly on the command line, or in a configuration file. The default location of the configuration file is `~/.shootproof`.

The configuration file may contain some or all of the following settings:

```
appId=<id>
accessToken=<token>
verbosity=<level>
haltOnError=true
retryLimit=<limit>
email=<email>
```

See `.shootproof-sample` for a minimal example of the configuration file.


## Required Permissions

* sp.album.create
* sp.album.get_photos
* sp.event.create
* sp.event.get_photos
* sp.event.set_access_level
