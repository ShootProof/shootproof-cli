Uploads photos in a directory or set of directories to a ShootProof
    event or album. Choose between the two using the --target-event
    parameter.

    If no event or album ID is passed, a new ShootProof event or album
    will be created automatically using the name of the directory. If
    --event-name or --album-name is passed, it will be created with the
    specified name. Additional album settings may be passed with
    --parent-album and --album-password.

    Push will compare the photos on ShootProof with the ones in a
    directory. New photos will be added to ShootProof; any photos not in
    the directory will be deleted from ShootProof. If the --replace
    option is specified, then matching photos in ShootProof will be
    overwritten with the ones from the directory.

    If the --preview option is passed, then the operation will not 
    actually execute, but a preview of the operation will be output.

    If no directory is specified, the current directory will be used. 
    Glob expressions are supported for processing multiple directories
    (each matching directory will be pushed to a separate ShootProof 
    event or album). Alternately, a list of directories may be piped 
    into this command.

    Options for this command may also be set in a .shootproof file in the
    directory:

        target=<target>
        event=<eventId>
        eventName=<name>
        album=<albumId>
        parentAlbum=<parentAlbumId>
        albumName=<name>
        albumPassword=<password>

    After this command completes successfully, a .shootproof file will be
    written to the directory for use in subsequent runs.
